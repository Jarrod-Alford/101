My string looks like this now: pumpkins #because += creates a new variable
#with a new object is, leaving the original unchanged.

My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"] #because the << method
#affects the original object (the object at that space in memory) and overwrites
#it with the new object.
